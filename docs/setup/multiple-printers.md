# Multiple Printers

Fluidd allows connecting and swapping between multiple printers.

In some circumstances, moonraker must be configured to allow a connection from fluidd. Configuration may depend on your type of install.

Please see the [moonraker configuration](../configuration/moonraker.md) docs for more information on setup.
