# Slicer Uploads

You can upload your sliced `gcode` from within PrusaSlicer or SuperSlicer. 

- With PrusaSlicer / SuperSlicer open, click through to `Printer Settings -> General` and find the `Printer Host Upload` section.
- Ensure the type is set to `OctoPrint`
- The `hostname / ip` is your printer URL. Typically this would be `fluidd.local` or similar.
- Enter some random characters in the API field.
- Click test!
